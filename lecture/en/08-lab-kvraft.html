<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
In this lab you will build a fault-tolerant key/value storage
service using your Raft library from
<a href="lab-raft.html">lab 2</a>. You
key/value service will be a replicated state machine, consisting of
several key/value servers that use Raft to maintain replication.
Your key/value service should continue to
process client requests as long as a majority of the servers
are alive and can communicate, in spite of other failures or
network partitions.

<p>
The service supports three operations: <tt>Put(key, value)</tt>,
<tt>Append(key, arg)</tt>, and <tt>Get(key)</tt>. It maintains a
simple database of key/value pairs. <tt>Put()</tt> replaces the value
for a particular key in the database, <tt>Append(key, arg)</tt>
appends arg to key's value, and <tt>Get()</tt> fetches the current
value for a key. An <tt>Append</tt> to a non-existant key should act
like <tt>Put</tt>. Each client talks to the service through
a <tt>Clerk</tt> with Put/Append/Get methods. A <tt>Clerk</tt> manages
RPC interactions with the servers.

<p>
Your service must provide strong consistency to applications calls to
the <tt>Clerk</tt> Get/Put/Append methods. Here's what we mean by
strong consistency. If called one at a time, the Get/Put/Append
methods should act as if the system had only one copy of its state,
and each call should observe the modifications to the state implied by
the preceding sequence of calls. For concurrent calls, the return
values and final state must be the same as if the operations had
executed one at a time in some order. Calls are concurrent if they
overlap in time, for example if client X calls <tt>Clerk.Put()</tt>,
then client Y calls <tt>Clerk.Append()</tt>, and then client X's call
returns. Furthermore, a call must observe the effects of all calls
that have completed before the call starts (so we are technically
asking for linearizability).

<p>
Strong consistency is convenient for applications because it means
that, informally, all clients see the same state and they all see the
latest state. Providing strong consistency is relatively easy for
a single server. It is harder if the service is replicated,
since all servers must choose the same execution order for
concurrent requests, and must avoid replying to clients using state
that isn't up to date.

<p>
This lab has two parts. In part A, you will implement the
service without worrying that the Raft log can grow without
bound. In part B, you will implement snapshots (Section 7 in
the paper), which will allow Raft to garbage collect old log
entries. Please submit each part by the respective deadline.

<ul class="hints">
<li>
This lab doesn't require you to write much code, but
you will most likely spend a substantial amount of time
thinking and staring at debugging logs to figure out
why your implementation doesn't work. Debugging will be
more challenging than in the Raft lab because there are
more components that work asynchronously of each other.
Start early.

<li>
You should reread the
<a href="../papers/raft-extended.pdf">extended Raft paper</a>,
in particular Sections 7 and 8. For a wider
perspective, have a look at Chubby, Raft Made Live,
Spanner, Zookeeper, Harp, Viewstamped Replication, and
<a href="http://static.usenix.org/event/nsdi11/tech/full_papers/Bolosky.pdf">Bolosky et al.</a>

<li>
You are allowed to add fields to the Raft <tt>ApplyMsg</tt>,
and to add fields to Raft RPCs such as <tt>AppendEntries</tt>.
But be sure that your code continues to pass the Lab 2 tests.

</ul>

<h3>Collaboration Policy</h3>

You must write all the code you hand in for 6.824, except for
code that we give you as part of the assignment. You are not
allowed to look at anyone else's solution, you are not allowed
to look at code from previous years, and you are not allowed to
look at other Raft implementations. You may discuss the
assignments with other students, but you may not look at or
copy each others' code.

<p>
Please do not publish your code or make
it available to current or future 6.824 students.
<tt>github.com</tt> repositories are public by default, so please
don't put your code there unless you make the repository private. You
may find it convenient to use
<a href="https://github.mit.edu/">MIT's GitHub</a>,
but be sure to create a private repository.

<h3>Getting Started</h3>

<div class="important">
<p>
Do a <tt>git pull</tt> to get the latest lab software.
</div>

<p>
We supply you with skeleton code and tests in <tt>src/kvraft</tt>. You will
need to modify <tt>kvraft/client.go</tt>, <tt>kvraft/server.go</tt>, and
perhaps <tt>kvraft/common.go</tt>.

<p>
To get up and running, execute the following commands:
<pre>
$ cd ~/6.824
$ git pull
...
$ cd src/kvraft
$ GOPATH=~/6.824
$ export GOPATH
$ go test
...
$</pre>

<h3>Part A: Key/value service without log compaction</h3>

<p>
Each of your key/value servers ("kvservers") will have an associated
Raft peer. Clerks send <tt>Put()</tt>, <tt>Append()</tt>,
and <tt>Get()</tt> RPCs to the kvserver whose associated Raft is the
leader. The kvserver code submits the Put/Append/Get operation to
Raft, so that the Raft log holds a sequence of Put/Append/Get
operations. All of the kvservers execute operations from the Raft log
in order, applying the operations to their key/value databases; the
intent is for the servers to maintain identical replicas of the
key/value database.

<p>
A <tt>Clerk</tt> sometimes doesn't
know which kvserver is the Raft leader. If the <tt>Clerk</tt> sends an
RPC to the wrong kvserver, or if it cannot reach the kvserver,
the <tt>Clerk</tt> should re-try by sending to a different kvserver.
If the key/value service commits the operation to its Raft log
(and hence applies the operation to the key/value state machine), the
leader reports the result to the <tt>Clerk</tt> by responding to its
RPC. If the operation failed to commit (for example, if the leader was
replaced), the server reports an error, and the <tt>Clerk</tt> retries with a
different server.

<div class="todo">
<p>
Your first task is to implement a solution that works when there are no dropped
messages, and no failed servers.

<p>
You'll need to add RPC-sending code to the Clerk Put/Append/Get
methods in <tt>client.go</tt>, and implement
<tt>PutAppend()</tt> and <tt>Get()</tt> RPC handlers in
<tt>server.go</tt>. These handlers should enter an
<tt>Op</tt> in the Raft log using <tt>Start()</tt>; you should fill in
the <tt>Op</tt> struct definition in <tt>server.go</tt> so that it
describes a Put/Append/Get operation. Each server should
execute <tt>Op</tt> commands as Raft commits them, i.e.
as they appear on the <tt>applyCh</tt>. An RPC handler
should notice when Raft commits its <tt>Op</tt>, and then reply to the
RPC.

<p>
You have completed this task when you
<strong>reliably</strong> pass the first test in the
test suite: "One client". You may also find that you
can pass the "concurrent clients" test, depending on
how sophisticated your implementation is.
</div>

<p class="note">
Your kvservers should not directly communicate; they
should only interact with each other through the Raft log.

<ul class="hints">
<li>
After calling <tt>Start()</tt>, your 
kvservers will need to wait for Raft to complete
agreement. Commands that have been agreed upon arrive
on the <tt>applyCh</tt>. You should think carefully
about how to arrange your code so that it will
keep reading <tt>applyCh</tt>, while
<tt>PutAppend()</tt> and <tt>Get()</tt> handlers submit
commands to the Raft log using <tt>Start()</tt>. It is
easy to achieve deadlock between the kvserver and its
Raft library.

<li>
Your solution needs to handle the case in
which a leader has called Start() for a Clerk's
RPC, but loses its leadership before the
request is committed to the log. In this case
you should arrange for the Clerk to re-send
the request to other servers until it finds
the new leader. One way to do this is for the
server to detect that it has lost leadership,
by noticing that a different request has
appeared at the index returned by Start(), or
that Raft's term has
changed. If the ex-leader is partitioned by
itself, it won't know about new leaders; but
any client in the same partition won't be able
to talk to a new leader either, so it's OK in
this case for the server and client to wait
indefinitely until the partition heals.

<li>
You will probably have to modify your 
Clerk to remember which server turned out to
be the leader for the last RPC, and send the
next RPC to that server first. This will avoid
wasting time searching for the leader on every
RPC, which may help you pass some of the tests
quickly enough.

<li>
A kvserver should not complete a <tt>Get()</tt>
RPC if it is not part of a majority (so that it does
not serve stale data). A simple solution is to enter
every <tt>Get()</tt> (as well as each <tt>Put()</tt>
and <tt>Append()</tt>) in the Raft log. You don't have
to implement the optimization for read-only operations
that is described in Section 8.

<li>
It's best to add locking from the start because the
need to avoid deadlocks sometimes affects overall code design. Check
that your code is race-free using
<tt>go test -race</tt>.

</ul>

In the face of unreliable connections and server failures, a
<tt>Clerk</tt> may send an RPC multiple times until it finds a 
kvserver that replies positively. If a leader fails just after
committing an entry to the Raft log, the <tt>Clerk</tt> may not
receive a reply, and thus may 
re-send the request to another leader.
Each call to
<tt>Clerk.Put()</tt> or <tt>Clerk.Append()</tt> should
result in just a single execution, so you will have to ensure
that the re-send doesn't result in the servers executing
the request twice.

<p class="todo">
Add code to cope with duplicate <tt>Clerk</tt> requests, including
situations where the <tt>Clerk</tt> sends a request to a kvserver leader
in one term, times out waiting for a reply, and re-sends the
request to a new leader in another term. The request
should always execute just once.
Your code should pass the <tt>go test -run 3A</tt> tests.

<ul class="hints">
<li>
You will need to uniquely identify client operations to ensure that
the key/value service executes each one just once.

<li>
Your scheme for duplicate detection should free server memory quickly,
for example by having each RPC imply that the client has seen the
reply for its previous RPC. It's OK to assume that a client will make
only one call into a Clerk at a time.

</ul>

<p>
Your code should now pass the Lab 3A tests, like this:

<div class="important">
<p>
Do a <tt>git pull</tt> to get the latest lab software.
</div>

<p>
As things stand now with your lab code, a rebooting server replays the
complete Raft log in order to restore its state. However, it's not
practical for a long-running server to remember the complete Raft log
forever. Instead, you'll modify Raft and kvserver to cooperate to save
space: from time to time kvserver will persistently store a "snapshot"
of its current state, and Raft will discard log entries that precede
the snapshot. When a server restarts (or falls far behind the leader
and must catch up), the server first installs a snapshot and then
replays log entries from after the point at which the snapshot
was created.
Section 7 of the
<a href="../papers/raft-extended.pdf">extended Raft paper</a>
outlines the scheme; you will have to design the details.

<p>
You should spend some time figuring out what the
interface will be between your Raft library and your
service so that your Raft library can discard log
entries. Think about how your Raft will operate while
storing only the tail of the log, and how it will
discard old log entries. You should discard them in a
way that allows the Go garbage collector to free and
re-use the memory; this requires that there be no
reachable references (pointers) to the discarded log
entries.

<p>
The tester passes <tt>maxraftstate</tt> to your
<tt>StartKVServer()</tt>. <tt>maxraftstate</tt> indicates the maximum
allowed size of your persistent Raft state in bytes (including the
log, but not including snapshots). You should
compare <tt>maxraftstate</tt> to <tt>persister.RaftStateSize()</tt>.
Whenever your key/value server detects that the Raft state size is
approaching this threshold, it should save a snapshot, and tell the
Raft library that it has snapshotted, so that Raft can discard old log
entries. If <tt>maxraftstate</tt> is -1, you do not have to snapshot.

<p class="todo">
Your <tt>raft.go</tt> probably keeps the entire log in a Go slice.
Modify it so that it can be given a log index, discard the entries
before that index, and continue operating while storing only log
entries after that index. Make sure you pass all the Raft tests after
making these changes.

<p class="todo">
Modify your kvserver so that it detects when the persisted
Raft state grows too large, and then hands a snapshot 
to Raft and tells
Raft that it can discard old log entries.
Raft should
save each snapshot with persister.SaveStateAndSnapshot()
(don't use files).
A kvserver instance should restore the snapshot from the
persister when it re-starts.

<ul class="hints">
<li>
You can test your Raft and kvserver's ability to operate with
a trimmed log, and its ability to re-start from the
combination of a kvserver snapshot and persisted Raft state,
by running the Lab 3A tests while artificially setting
<tt>maxraftstate</tt> to 1.
<li>
Think about when a kvserver should snapshot its state
and what should be included in the snapshot. Raft must
store each snapshot in the persister object using
<tt>SaveStateAndSnapshot()</tt>,
along with corresponding Raft state.
You can read the
latest stored snapshot using <tt>ReadSnapshot()</tt>.
<li>
Your kvserver must be able to detect
duplicated operations in the log across checkpoints, so any
state you are using to detect them must be included in
the snapshots. Remember to capitalize all fields of
structures stored in the snapshot.
<li>
You are allowed to add methods to your Raft so that
kvserver can manage the process of trimming the Raft
log and manage kvserver snapshots.
</ul>

<p class="todo">
Modify your Raft leader code to send an InstallSnapshot
RPC to a follower when the leader has discarded the log
entries the follower needs.
When a follower receives an InstallSnapshot RPC,
your Raft code will need to send the included snapshot to
its kvserver. You can use the <tt>applyCh</tt>
for this purpose, by adding new fields to <tt>ApplyMsg</tt>.
Your
solution is complete when it passes all of the Lab 3 tests.

<p class="note">
The <tt>maxraftstate</tt> limit applies to the GOB-encoded
bytes your Raft passes to <tt>persister.SaveRaftState()</tt>.

<ul class="hints">

<li>
You should send the entire snapshot in a single InstallSnapshot RPC.
You do not have to implement Figure 13's <tt>offset</tt> mechanism for
splitting up the snapshot.

<li>
Make sure you pass <tt>TestSnapshotRPC</tt> before
moving on to the other Snapshot tests.

<li>
A reasonable amount of time to take for the Lab 3 tests is 400 seconds
of real time and 700 seconds of CPU time. Further,
<tt>go test -run TestSnapshotSize</tt> should take less than 20
seconds of real time.

</ul>

<p>
Your code should pass the 3B tests (as in the example here) as well
as the 3A tests.
